A mini game about a ball

Game : you have to advance through puzzles, and defeat enemies by controling a ball with the environment. 
Controls : Press arrows keys or "aswd" to move planes, press "Space bar" to jump and left click to attack. 

I've never edited a .gitignore before so I'm not sure everything will work fine.
